## **Overview**
This repository is a practical implementation of an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline combining the strengths of Word2Vec, BERT, and GPT models. It supports vector-based semantic search, sentence encoding, and AI-driven text generation.

By leveraging these models, users can:
- Create meaningful embeddings for text.
- Perform contextual sentence analysis.
- Generate coherent AI-based responses.

## **Features**
- **Word Embeddings**:
  - Generate word-level embeddings using the Word2Vec model.
- **Sentence Encoding**:
  - Transform sentences into contextual embeddings using pre-trained BERT models.
- **Vector Search**:
  - Perform efficient similarity searches with FAISS.
- **Text Generation**:
  - Generate natural language responses using GPT models.
